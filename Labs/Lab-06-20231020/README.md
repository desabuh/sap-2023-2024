# Software Architecture and Platforms - a.y. 2023-2024

## Lab #06-20231020 - [Repo](https://github.com/pslab-unibo/sap-2023-2024.git) 

In [previous lab  (20231016)](https://github.com/pslab-unibo/sap-2023-2024/blob/master/Labs/Lab-05-20231016/README.md), we focused on the hexagonal/ports & adapters architecture, as a monolithic architecture.

 In this lab, we move to distributed architectures introducing [Microservices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k6xXXp0fw8D9ufqlhcAXV89_oFeVUlq98-pT0MtbHM0/edit?usp=sharing), a main reference nowdays for engineering complex distributed systems.

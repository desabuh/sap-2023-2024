# Assignment #3 - 20231016 - From Layered to  Ports & Adapters / Hexagonal Architecture

- **Description:** Consider the (partial) implementation of the E-Scooters case study discussed in lab [20231013](https://github.com/pslab-unibo/sap-2023-2024/blob/master/Labs/Lab-04-20231013/README.md), based on a layered architecture. The objective of the assignment is to: 
	- revise the design by applying a [Ports & Adapters / Hexagonal Architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PomKasGfZQuLNWwfVzK-DS-SLcZk_oKniPfgVKsSd8U/edit?usp=sharing) 
	- add a port and one adapter to enable the possibility to monitor the number of ongoing rides (e.g. a dashboard for EScooters management) 
	- add an adapter for a concrete DB technology (examples can be MongoDB or MySQL) 

- **Deliverable**:  
	- README.md text file including the link to a Github repo, containing the implementation (that can be improved and extended over time). PS: It can be the same report used in previous assignment(s).

- **Deadlines**
	- October 27 (For submitting the text file)
